Architecture of NodeJs=>
    Node APIs contain Asynchronous type of code where as Call Stack contain Synchronous type of code.
    Callback queue -> callstack -> Node APIs => Event Loop

Features of Nodejs=>
    1. Single Thread -- it has only one callstack to execute at a time 
    2. Synchronous -- code run in a particular sequence of operations.
    3. Non-Blocking -- execute the program without waiting for long input/output operations.

Primitive datatypes in Javascript=>
    1.let -- initialise within the scope
    2.var -- initialise the element irrespective of the scope,prints without any error.
    3.const -- cannot initialise again if already done one time.
